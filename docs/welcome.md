### Welcome to Leaf's Documentation!

Food and Agriculture developers use Leaf's API to access clean, standardized,
and aggregated Farm data from all major sources. Use the  getting started
section below  to help you access sample farm data quickly, easily, and securely.
We have implementation examples in cURL, NodeJS and Python!

Getting Started

Leaf's API abstracts and standardizes across agricultural data sources to make
things easy for you. There are just a few concepts that you need to get started
and we provide sample data within new Leaf accounts to help you learn quickly.


:::tip
Below you'll find instructions using curl and python, but you may also follow
along using our [Leaf Postman collection](https://github.com/Leaf-Agriculture/Leaf-quickstart-Postman-collection)
if you're familiar.
