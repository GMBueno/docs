### Welcome to Leaf's Documentation!

Developers use Leaf's API to access clean, standardized,
and aggregated Farm data from all major food & agriculture brands.
Please see the [Quickstart](https://leaf-agriculture.github.io/docs/docs/quickstart) section to get started with sample farm data & popular use cases.
We have implementation examples in cURL, NodeJS and Python!

Getting Started

Leaf's API abstracts and standardizes across agricultural data sources so you can focus on building value with farm data.
There are just a few concepts that you need to get started and we provide sample data within new Leaf accounts to help you learn quickly.


:::tip
Below you'll find instructions using curl and python, and you may also follow
along using our [Leaf Postman collection](https://github.com/Leaf-Agriculture/Leaf-quickstart-Postman-collection).
